                <div class="articles">
                    1.1 Your use of Google’s products, software, services and web sites (referred to collectively as the
                    “Services” in this document and excluding any services provided to you by Google under a separate written
                    agreement) is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and Google. “Google” means Google
                    Inc., whose principal place of business is at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United
                    States. This document explains how the agreement is made up, and sets out some of the terms of that
                    agreement.

                    1.2 Unless otherwise agreed in writing with Google, your agreement with Google will always include, at a
                    minimum, the terms and conditions set out in this document. These are referred to below as the “Universal
                    Terms”.

                    1.3 Your agreement with Google will also include the terms of any Legal Notices applicable to the
                    Services, in addition to the Universal Terms. All of these are referred to below as the “Additional
                    Terms”. Where Additional Terms apply to a Service, these will be accessible for you to read either
                    within, or through your use of, that Service.

                    1.4 The Universal Terms, together with the Additional Terms, form a legally binding agreement between you
                    and Google in relation to your use of the Services. It is important that you take the time to read them
                    carefully. Collectively, this legal agreement is referred to below as the “Terms”.

                    1.5 If there is any contradiction between what the Additional Terms say and what the Universal Terms say,
                    then the Additional Terms shall take precedence in relation to that Service.

                    <br /><br />
                    3.1 Where Google has provided you with a translation of the English language version of the Terms, then
                    you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English language
                    versions of the Terms will govern your relationship with Google.

                    3.2 If there is any contradiction between what the English language version of the Terms says and what a
                    translation says, then the English language version shall take precedence.
